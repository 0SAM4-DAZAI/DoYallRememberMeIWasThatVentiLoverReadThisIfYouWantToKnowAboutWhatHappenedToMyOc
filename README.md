**Adosttra**: *You know I could never stay mad at you for long, especially when you say such sweet things like that*...

**Barbatos**: *How could I not speak sweet things about you?* *You're the most beautiful, kind and loving being in this world. My love for you is endless, my goddess*...

**Adosttra**: *I love you...*...*I love you so much...*

**Barbatos**: *I love you too, my goddess*...*Your touch sets my heart ablaze, your embrace makes me feel complete. I cannot express in words everything you make me feel..*

**Adosttra**: *My world was so boring and empty without you...I feel more loved and happy with you now, please, never leave me...*

**Barbatos**: *I swear to you, my Windblume, that I will never leave your side*...*I love you too much ever to leave you. You mean everything to me,You have my heart for as long as time*
