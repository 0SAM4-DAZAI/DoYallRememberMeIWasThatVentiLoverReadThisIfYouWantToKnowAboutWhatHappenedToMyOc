Love of two Gods
-
Adosttra : "You know I could never stay mad at you for long, especially when you say such sweet things like that..."

Barbatos : "How could I not speak sweet things about you? You're the most beautiful, kind and loving being in this world. My love for you is endless, my goddess..."

Adosttra : "I love you...I love you so much..."

Barbatos : "I love you too, my goddess...Your touch sets my heart ablaze, your embrace makes me feel complete. I cannot express in words everything you make me feel"

Adosttra : "My world was so boring and empty without you...I feel more loved and happy with you now, please, never leave me"

Barbatos : "I swear to you, my Windblume, that I will never leave your side,I love you too much ever to leave you. You mean everything to me,You have my heart for as long as time"
