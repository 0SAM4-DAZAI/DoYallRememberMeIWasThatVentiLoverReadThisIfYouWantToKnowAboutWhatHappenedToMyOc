YALL I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL CONTINUE DOING STUFF OF MY GENSHIN OCS !! I don't really care about them rn üíîüíî 
</p>

<p align="center">
I also stopped playing gi cuz of my storage, I'll probably install it again when I get my damn phone üôè A friend of mine is taking care of it while I'm away, so I recommend to not chat me there, cuz the one who's going to respond is not me

So, I'm not that interested in genshin as I was on the past, and it made me forget remake my ocs . As you can see, I changed from genshin to bsd! Now about my oc . . . do you remember that the birdy was called "Aura" or "Adosttra"? Well no more! It's Ados now! I even changed his gender boo...I also no longer made him a God, yes he is still a celestial being but not a God or wtv! His appearance is almost the same, only that he is a man now. As some know, I like to write but it shows that my imagination does not exist so I do not share my stories or lore !
</p>

<p align="center">
Does he still have those wings? OF COURSE!! I won't change the wings that he has on his ears, so don't change the fact that he came from a God and was a feather first!! I just love them, bro
</p>

<p align="center">
Does have have wings on the back too? I know that his past version didn't have wings on the back, but I decided to change that and also put wings on his back, not very big though, they are small because yes, I don't even know. Now that's a birdie!!
</p>

<p align="center">
What happened to the divinity and loyalty thing? It went to shit!! He is no longer the God of anything, and I can continue putting a thing on him that represents him but... It would be practically the same as his mother's, not 100% but yah! Like 'hope' and 'creation', but the last one doesn't count because Ados can't create anything ahaha, though Ados is still loyal and divine ofc üòú this all sounds confusing even for me im going to go insane
</p>

<p align="center">
So the mother is still the same? Exactly!! Only that she didn't make Ados a God, she didn't have strenght bro she was dying so after finally creating Ados, his mom died üòùüòù (No, I'm not saying her name because she still doesn't have one, I'm not saying it because I don't remember it, i'll probably create a new one)
</p>

<p align="center">
Does that one spirit still haunts Ados? Of course, I didn't change that in the lore either! Yeah, I didn't change the shitty suffering of that day üíî
</p>

<p align="center">
What about his titles? They are gone too,buddy...
</p>

<p align="center">
So what was he doing in Celestia? I don't know, he's not a God but I mean, he comes from one! He didn't do much there, He spent more time anywhere that wasn't Celestia. But they always welcomed him. Ados spent more time at 'Divine's heart', a place made by Dameros. Ados mostly helped the Gods and Goddesses, in the meetings he only saw them from afar, although he didn't care. It doesn't seem like it but Ados was loved and important there!
</p>

<p align="center">
Is his love interest the same? Yep! It's the same one, which would be Venti/Barbatos :3
</p>

<p align="center">
Is Ados a self-insert? Uhh, not really. I remember being a big fan of Venti, so I saw a lot of people make an ocxcanon of him, so I decided to make one too! I always said that my oc was 'me', but that was only because I loved the character, the truth is the only thing similar about Aura and I was our love for Venti. Then, I changed the gender from woman to man since then I could feel more comfortable saying that Ados is like me, but I said all that because Ados is my main oc and Venti his love interest. Ados and I are not the same at all, it's just the gender and that's it...I don't like Venti that much anymore. Ados or Aura was created by my pure imagination, I didn't even think about making them like me

Do you think you will continue continuing on the info of more ocs? No. Most likely not, but I want to have them as a memory when I was crazy trying to think of good lore! If I continue with my ocs, they would only have new names or appearances . 

<p align="center">
Why is all of this a bullshit? Yeah mf I knoww, I'm bad creating this but look at me üòî istg next time I won't create so many ocs
