*"Two deities intertwined together, their love woven in the heavens above*

*Barbatos and Adosttra, who for all time have stayed true to the love that they vowed*

*Years have passed them by, but their love only deepens with time*

*Eternal and unwavering, their love, both bright and sublime*

*Their union strong, their love only growing, together they'll forever find*

*For even the gods themselves, know that such love is truly divine"*
